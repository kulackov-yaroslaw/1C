I selected the countries with the highest total mortality and decided for them to restore the dependence of cases of infection on time. As you can see from the first look, the function is similar to a sigmoid. I decided to write my "grid-search" to find the optimal sigmoid parameters. The l2 metric was used. After that, I decided to look at the percentage of deaths to infections. An unusual dependence appeared, and it seemed to me that from some point on it was also described by a sigmoid. Unfortunately, due to the limited time, I did not manage to figure out why this time my "grid-search" finds unoptimal solutions. But the plans were to define a function and apply it to countries with a small amount of data (this is already trivial).

P.S. I am not a professional in the data science, but I took up this task, and not the task of algorithms, because I think that this is much more interesting, this is a challenge. And although not everything worked out, I hope you appreciate my impulse.
